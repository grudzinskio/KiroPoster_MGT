# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completely replaces the existing email-based authentication system with a username-only authentication system. Users will authenticate using a unique username and password combination, and email addresses will be entirely removed from the system.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The system component responsible for verifying user credentials and managing login sessions
- **Username**: A unique alphanumeric identifier chosen by the user for login purposes
- **Login_Credentials**: The combination of username and password used for authentication
- **User_Account**: A registered user profile containing personal information, credentials, and permissions
- **Database_Schema**: The structured format of data storage including tables and relationships

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in using a username instead of an email address, so that I can have a more personalized and memorable login experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE Authentication_System SHALL accept a username field instead of an email field
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate that the username exists in the system before proceeding with password verification
3. IF the username does not exist, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition period
5. WHEN authentication is successful, THE Authentication_System SHALL return the same user session data as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose a unique username when creating my account, so that I can establish my preferred login identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new account, THE User_Account SHALL require a unique username field
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate that the username contains only alphanumeric characters and allowed special characters
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL enforce username length requirements between 3 and 30 characters
4. IF a username is already taken, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent account creation and display an appropriate error message
5. THE User_Account SHALL store only username and password, removing all email-related fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing users to have usernames automatically generated, so that the system can transition smoothly without requiring immediate user action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated, THE Database_Schema SHALL add a username field to existing user records
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL generate unique usernames for existing users based on their current email addresses
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL ensure all generated usernames follow the same validation rules as manually created ones
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL handle username conflicts during generation by appending numeric suffixes
5. THE Database_Schema SHALL remove the email field from the user table after username migration is complete

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update my username after account creation, so that I can change it if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to change their username, THE Authentication_System SHALL validate the new username availability
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL apply the same validation rules as during account creation
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL update the username while preserving all other account data
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL log the username change for audit purposes
5. WHEN the username is successfully changed, THE Authentication_System SHALL confirm the update to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend login form to use username fields, so that users see the correct interface for the new authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page, THE Authentication_System SHALL display a username input field instead of an email field
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL update form validation to check for username format instead of email format
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL update error messages to reference usernames instead of email addresses
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain the same user experience flow for successful and failed login attempts
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL remove all email-related functionality from the user interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all email-related features removed from the system, so that the application operates entirely without email dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL remove password reset functionality that depends on email
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL remove any email validation or verification processes
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL update all API endpoints to use username instead of email parameters
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL remove email fields from all user-related database queries
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL update all user search and lookup functionality to use usernames instead of email addresses
